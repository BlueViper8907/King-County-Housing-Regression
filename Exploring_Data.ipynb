    "I would like to take the average household statistics from the range of bedrooms, bathrooms, zipcodes etc and adjust the average of all the zeros that show up in those ranges with the averages of those areas. Possibly change the waterfront views that are set to zero in that are near the lat's and long's as well from zeros and put them as ones to better represent the data a little more accurately. After taking a look at that and making sure thats acceptable I will start by setting a function to graph the data on a map.(Don't take too long on this as it is a decent representation of the information it is also not needed).\n",

    "Possible representation of the data could be through zipcode and bin them in with each other and set them out as zones as well. Could take a look at the 'Areas' as a way to make sense of the data and the pricing of each. could also set up a function to pull specific information for the conditions of what a particular pearson wants as well as a budget. Taking note from both House Hunters and DIY shows on what it is that could be done with deemable 'Fixer Uppers' with a certain budget. Set that function towards anything below their budget and whether they want to fix a place up or not. If time alloted I will use the map made earlier to graph the places and show where those places are adjesent to important places like hospitals, schools, possibly shopping centers, etc. Could also figure a way to find out if the zones have crime rates etc around them and deem if it is a safe neighborhood.\n",
